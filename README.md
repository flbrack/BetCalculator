# Project for an app that calculates the payout from various bet types.

Bored by my job working in a bookmakers, I decided to try my hand at making a GUI application for the first time.

There are two scripts. The first BetTypes.py, handles the backend calculation, implemented using OOP. I prototyped these in a Jupyter notebok which I have also included.
The BetCalculator.py file is for the frontend GUI using the Python Tkinter library.

At the moment I have the basic functionality working.

Future development would include proper exception handling, and adding functionality for less common bet outcomes, such as dead heats and rule 4's.
